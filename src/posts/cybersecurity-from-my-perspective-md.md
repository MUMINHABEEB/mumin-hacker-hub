🔐 Cybersecurity From My Perspective



Cybersecurity is something I’ve been learning and paying attention to because it’s not just a tech buzzword anymore — it’s part of our daily life. From emails to cloud storage, everything around us is connected, and that also means everything can be attacked.



What I’ve learned so far is that \*\*cybersecurity isn’t just about tools, it’s about awareness\*\*. Even if you don’t know how to use advanced hacking techniques or complicated defense systems, just being aware of threats already gives you a strong advantage.



🕵️ Types of Threats I’ve Noticed



1. Phishing – Fake emails or websites that trick you into giving your passwords.

2. Weak Passwords – People still use \`123456\` or \`password\`. Hackers love that.

3. Open Ports – If your system has unnecessary open ports, it’s like leaving your door unlocked.

4. Social Engineering – Hackers don’t always break in with code, sometimes they just trick people.



 ☁️ Cybersecurity & the Cloud



Since a lot of services are now cloud-based, I realized that security has shifted. It’s not just about protecting your PC anymore, but also about protecting data on platforms like AWS, Google Cloud, or Microsoft Azure. Cloud security is huge because businesses depend on it daily.



 🛡️ Basic Practices I Follow



\* Never click random links.

\* Use strong, unique passwords.

\* Keep software updated.

\* Double-check websites before entering sensitive info.

\* Learn continuously — because threats keep evolving.



🚀 Why I Care About This



For me, cybersecurity is not only about protecting systems but also about protecting \*\*trust\*\*. If someone loses their money or data, it’s not just a technical issue, it’s an emotional one too. That’s why I’m motivated to learn more — whether it’s SOC analysis, penetration testing, or cloud security.
